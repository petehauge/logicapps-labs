# AI Loan Agent

An AI-powered loan approval system that automates the evaluation of vehicle loan applications using Azure Logic Apps Standard and Azure OpenAI. The agent autonomously analyzes loan applications, calls verification tools, evaluates risk, and makes approval decisions or escalates complex cases to human reviewers.

## Explore

After deployment, test the agent with different loan scenarios to see how it autonomously makes decisions.

### Run a test

1. Open [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) > your resource group > Logic App > **Workflows** > **LoanApprovalAgent** > [**Run history**](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/monitor-logic-apps#review-runs-history)

   <img src="images/navigate-to-designer.png" alt="Navigate to workflow designer" width="600">

2. Click **Run** > [**Run with payload**](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/test-logic-apps-track-results#run-with-payload)
3. Paste one of the test payloads below and select **Run**. Wait a few seconds for the workflow to finish; on the **Output** tab you’ll see `Status Code: 200` and the agent’s decision message in the response body.
4. (Optional) Select to open the monitoring view if you want to inspect the workflow execution in detail. The monitoring view shows action inputs/outputs, agent token usage per iteration, and agent tool calls in the **Agent log** tab (for example, **Send Customer Email**).

   <img src="images/agent-log-history.png" alt="Agent log history view" width="600">



**Test these scenarios to see different decision paths:**

<details>
<summary><b>Test scenario 1: Auto-approval</b></summary>

Strong credit, modest loan amount:

```json
{"applicationId":"APP-AUTO-APPROVE-001","name":"Applicant A","email":"applicant.a@example.com","loanAmount":25000,"vehicleMake":"Toyota","vehicleModel":"Camry","salary":75000,"employmentYears":5}
```

**Expected result:** Response body confirms approval with loan amount; `decision` = `"APPROVED"`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Test scenario 2: Edge case</b></summary>

High loan amount, strong financial profile:

```json
{"applicationId":"APP-REVIEW-REQUIRED-002","name":"Applicant B","email":"applicant.b@example.com","loanAmount":55000,"vehicleMake":"BMW","vehicleModel":"X5","salary":95000,"employmentYears":3}
```

**Expected result:** Edge case. Response body may explain the request is under human review (loan amount > limit, higher risk, luxury vehicle). `decision` most often `"PENDING"`, but approvals/declines are possible.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Test scenario 3: Auto-rejection</b></summary>

Weak credit score, bankruptcy history:

```json
{"applicationId":"APP-AUTO-REJECT-003","name":"Applicant C","email":"applicant.c@example.com","loanAmount":30000,"vehicleMake":"Honda","vehicleModel":"Accord","salary":45000,"employmentYears":0.5}
```

**Expected result:** Response body states the application was declined for low credit, short employment history, and bankruptcy history; `decision` = `"REJECTED"`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Test scenario 4: Human escalation</b></summary>

Luxury vehicle requiring additional review:

```json
{"applicationId":"APP-LUXURY-REVIEW-004","name":"Applicant D","email":"applicant.d@example.com","loanAmount":80000,"vehicleMake":"Ferrari","vehicleModel":"F8 Tributo","salary":120000,"employmentYears":4}
```

**Expected result:** Response body confirms approval after review with loan amount; `decision` = `"APPROVED"`. Monitoring view shows "Get special vehicles" and "Wait for Human Review" before completion.

</details>

**Tips:** 
- Review **Agent log** tab to see which tools the agent called
- Check **Metadata** tab (under Loan Agent action) for token usage statistics
- Runs complete in 5-15 seconds

## Workflows

Five workflows process loan applications using autonomous AI decision-making:

<details>
<summary><b>Workflow details</b></summary>


### LoanApprovalAgent

Orchestrates loan approval using an AI agent. The agent evaluates applications against business rules, autonomously selecting and sequencing tools.

**Agent Tools:**
- Get loan approval policy - Retrieves approval/rejection criteria
- Get customer bank history - Fetches customer banking records
- Get applicant risk profile - Evaluates financial risk
- Get special vehicles - Checks for luxury vehicle requirements
- Send customer email - Sends approval/rejection notification
- Wait for human review - Escalates to human approver when needed

**Process Flow:**

    H --> F
    I --> F
    J --> F
    K --> F
    
    F --> N[Loan Post Processing]
    N --> O[HTTP Response]
```

### GetCustomerHistory

Retrieves simulated customer banking history including balance, transaction patterns, and debt-to-income ratio. In production, this would integrate with banking APIs.

### GetRiskProfile

Evaluates applicant risk based on loan amount, annual salary, employment years, credit score, and bankruptcy history. Returns a comprehensive risk assessment.

### GetSpecialVehicles

Checks if the requested vehicle is classified as a luxury or high-value vehicle that requires additional approval steps. Uses a reference list for demonstration.

### LoanPostProcessing

Handles post-decision workflows such as logging, analytics, and integration with external systems. Currently a placeholder for extending the sample.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Required Connections</b></summary>

This sample uses Azure OpenAI with Managed Identity authentication for passwordless access.

| Connection Name | Connector Name | Connector Type | Purpose |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Azure OpenAI Connection | Azure OpenAI | Agent | Powers the AI agent decision-making in LoanApprovalAgent workflow |

**Authentication:** System-Assigned Managed Identity with `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` role assigned to Azure OpenAI resource during deployment.

<details>
<summary><b>Deployment automation</b></summary>

The Deploy to Azure button uses a two-stage process:

**Build** (manual via [`BundleAssets.ps1`](1ClickDeploy/BundleAssets.ps1)):
- Compiles [Bicep modules](Deployment/infrastructure/) → [`sample-arm.json`](1ClickDeploy/sample-arm.json)
- Bundles [workflow definitions](LogicApps/) → [`workflows.zip`](1ClickDeploy/workflows.zip)

**Deploy** (automated):
- [ARM (Azure Resource Manager)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) template provisions Azure resources
- Embedded deployment script configures RBAC and deploys workflows
