# AI Product Return Agent

An AI-powered product return system that automates the evaluation of return requests using Azure Logic Apps Standard and Azure OpenAI. The agent autonomously analyzes return requests, validates policies, checks order details, evaluates customer status, calculates refunds, and makes approval decisions or escalates complex cases to human reviewers.

## Deploy

**Prerequisites:**
- Azure subscription with contributor access
- Region supporting Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini) and Logic Apps Standard - see [region selection](#region-selection)

**Deploy to your Azure subscription:**

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Flogicapps-labs%2Fmain%2Fsamples%2Fproduct-return-agent-sample%2FDeployment%2Fsample-arm.json)

<details>
<summary><b>What happens when you deploy</b></summary>

1. Opens Azure Portal and prompts for subscription, [resource group](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal) (create new recommended: `rg-productreturn`)
2. Provisions Azure resources (Logic App, OpenAI, Storage, App Service Plan, Managed Identity)
3. Configures [RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/overview) permissions for passwordless authentication
4. Deploys AI agent workflows with built-in test scenarios

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What gets deployed</b></summary>

## Explore

After deployment, test the agent with different return scenarios to see how it autonomously makes decisions.

### Run a test

1. Open [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) > your resource group > Logic App > **Workflows** > **ProductReturnAgent** > [**Run history**](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/monitor-logic-apps#review-runs-history)
2. Click **Run** > [**Run with payload**](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/test-logic-apps-track-results#run-with-payload)
3. Paste one of the test payloads below > **Run** (returns success)
4. Click **Refresh** > click the **Identifier** to open monitoring view
5. In **Agent log** tab, review which tools the agent called
6. In workflow, click **Product Return Agent** action > **Outputs** tab > verify `decision` and `refundAmount` fields

**Test these scenarios to see different decision paths:**

<details>
<summary><b>Test scenario 1: Defective item - Auto-approval</b></summary>

Coffee maker reported as defective, within return window:

```json
{"orderId":"ORD001","customerId":"CUST001","reason":"defective","description":"Coffee maker stopped working after 10 days","imageData":"https://example.com/images/ORD001-product.jpg"}
```

**Expected result:** `decision` = `"APPROVED"` with `refundAmount` = `150` in Product Return Agent action outputs, full refund for defective item

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Test scenario 2: Opened perishable - Auto-rejection</b></summary>

Opened coffee beans, perishable item:

```json
{"orderId":"ORD002","customerId":"CUST002","reason":"changed_mind","description":"Don't like the flavor","imageData":"https://example.com/images/ORD002-product.jpg"}
```

**Expected result:** `decision` = `"REJECTED"` with `refundAmount` = `0` in Product Return Agent action outputs, perishable items cannot be returned once opened

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Test scenario 3: Order not found - Auto-rejection</b></summary>

Order doesn't exist in system:

```json
{"orderId":"ORD005","customerId":"CUST004","reason":"changed_mind","description":"Want to return this item","imageData":"https://example.com/images/ORD005-product.jpg"}
```

**Expected result:** `decision` = `"REJECTED"` with `refundAmount` = `0` in Product Return Agent action outputs, order not found

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Test scenario 4: High-value fraud risk - Escalation</b></summary>

Premium customer with excessive return history, expensive item:

```json
{"orderId":"ORD003","customerId":"CUST003","reason":"changed_mind","description":"Decided to get a different model","imageData":"https://example.com/images/ORD003-product.jpg"}
```

**Expected result:** `decision` = `"ESCALATED"` with `refundAmount` = `0` in Product Return Agent action outputs. Agent log shows "Escalate_to_human" tool call for manual review.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Test scenario 5: Opened electronics - Approved with fee</b></summary>

Opened electronics with restocking fee:

```json
{"orderId":"ORD004","customerId":"CUST001","reason":"changed_mind","description":"Found a better price elsewhere","imageData":"https://example.com/images/ORD004-opened.jpg"}
```

**Expected result:** `decision` = `"APPROVED"` with `refundAmount` = `96` in Product Return Agent action outputs (20% restocking fee applied to $120 order)

</details>

**Tips:**
- Review **Agent log** tab to see which tools the agent called
- Check **Metadata** tab (under Product Return Agent action) for token usage statistics
- Runs complete in 5-15 seconds

## Workflows

Three workflows process product return requests using autonomous AI decision-making:

<details>
<summary><b>Workflow details</b></summary>

### ProductReturnAgent

Orchestrates return approval using an AI agent. The agent evaluates requests against business rules, autonomously selecting and sequencing tools.

**Agent Tools:**
- **Get_return_policy** - Retrieves return policy rules and conditions
- **Get_order_details** - Fetches order information including product, price, purchase date
- **Analyze_product_image** - Analyzes product photos to detect damage and assess condition
- **Get_return_history** - Checks customer return patterns and fraud flags
- **Get_customer_status** - Checks if customer is Premium (60-day window) or Standard (30-day window)
- **Calculate_refund** - Computes refund amount based on reason, category, and condition
- **Notify_customer** - Sends email notification with return decision and refund details
- **Escalate_to_human** - Routes complex cases to human review

**Process Flow:**

    F --> D
    G --> D
    H --> D
    I --> J[Manual Review]
    
    D --> K[Response]
    J --> K
```

### GetOrderHistory

Retrieves simulated order data including product details, purchase date, and condition. In production, this would integrate with e-commerce or ERP systems.

### CalculateRefund

Evaluates refund amounts based on return reason, product category, and condition. Returns calculated refund following business rules for restocking fees and shipping charges.

<details>
<summary><b>Required Connections</b></summary>

This sample uses Azure OpenAI with Managed Identity authentication for passwordless access.

| Connection Name | Connector Name | Connector Type | Purpose |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Azure OpenAI Connection | Azure OpenAI | Agent | Powers the AI agent decision-making in ProductReturnAgent workflow |

**Authentication:** System-Assigned Managed Identity with `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` role assigned to Azure OpenAI resource during deployment.

<details>
<summary><b>Deployment automation</b></summary>

The Deploy to Azure button uses a two-stage process:

**Build** (manual via [`BundleAssets.ps1`](../shared/scripts/BundleAssets.ps1)):
- Compiles [Bicep modules](../shared/modules/) → [`sample-arm.json`](Deployment/sample-arm.json)
- Bundles [workflow definitions](LogicApps/) → [`workflows.zip`](Deployment/workflows.zip)

**Deploy** (automated):
- [ARM (Azure Resource Manager)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/overview) template provisions Azure resources
- Embedded deployment script configures RBAC and deploys workflows

[Learn about ARM deployment scripts](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/deployment-script-bicep)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Sample data approach</b></summary>

This sample uses built-in test data to simplify exploration:
- **Order database:** `Compose` actions with 5 mock orders
- **Customer status:** Hardcoded Premium detection
- **Image analysis:** Pattern-matching mock
- **Refund calculation:** Formula-based logic
- **Human escalation:** Conditional logic (no Teams integration)
