## Explore

After deployment, test the conversational agent to see how it guides you through work order repair workflows



### Run a test

1. Open [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) > your resource group > Logic App > **Workflows** > **TransactionRepairAgent**
2. Click **Overview** > **Chat** button to [start a conversation with the agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/create-conversational-agent-workflows#run-and-test-your-conversational-agent)
3. Type or paste one of the test prompts below
4. Watch the agent retrieve work order details, propose fixes, check approvals, and log to ITSM
5. (Optional) Check [**Run history**](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/monitor-logic-apps#review-runs-history) to see nested workflow calls

**Test these scenarios to see different decision paths:**

<details>
<summary><b>Test scenario 1: Schema validation failure (approved)</b></summary>

Chat prompt:
```
Process work order WO-12345
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Agent retrieves work order (schema_validation_error, $250 amount)
- Proposes fix: Convert amount from string to number, validate schema
- Checks approval → **APPROVED**
- Resubmits corrected work order
- Logs to ITSM (generates incident ID like INC416577)
- Confirms completion and offers help with another work order

**Run history shows:** 5 nested workflow calls (GetWorkOrder → GetFixPlan → GetApproval → ResubmitWorkOrder → LogToITSM)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Test scenario 2: Timeout configuration (denied)</b></summary>

Chat prompt:
```
Let's start by retrieving the details of the failed work order WO-67890
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Agent retrieves work order (timeout_config, 30s timeout)
- Proposes fix: Increase timeout to 300s, add retry policy
- Checks approval → **DENIED**
- Skips resubmission (correctly follows denial)
- Logs to ITSM automatically for audit trail
- Confirms completion

**Run history shows:** 4 nested workflow calls (GetWorkOrder → GetFixPlan → GetApproval → LogToITSM, skips ResubmitWorkOrder)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Test scenario 3: Missing required field (approved)</b></summary>

Chat prompt:
```
Help me fix work order WO-11111
```

**Expected behavior:**
- Agent retrieves work order (missing_required_field, customerId/productId)
- Proposes fix: Add missing field, apply field mapping
- Checks approval → **APPROVED**
- Resubmits corrected work order
- Logs to ITSM (generates incident ID like INC217995)
- Confirms completion and offers help with another work order

**Run history shows:** 5 nested workflow calls (GetWorkOrder → GetFixPlan → GetApproval → ResubmitWorkOrder → LogToITSM)

</details>

**Tips:**

- Agent is conversational and explains each step
- Agent calls **one tool per turn** (retrieves info, proposes fix, checks approval, etc.)
- Review **Run history** to see nested workflow execution
- Check run details for token usage in **Metadata** tab
- Conversations complete in 15-30 seconds (multiple turns)

## Workflows

Six workflows process work order repairs using conversational AI interaction:

<details>
<summary><b>Workflow details</b></summary>

### TransactionRepairAgent

Conversational agent that guides users through work order repair workflows. The agent analyzes failed work orders, proposes fixes, manages approvals, resubmits transactions, and logs all activities to ITSM for audit compliance.

**Agent Tools (Nested Workflows):**
- **Get_failed_workorder** - Retrieves failed work order details by tracking ID (calls GetWorkOrder workflow)
- **Propose_fix** - Analyzes failure type and proposes repair steps (calls GetFixPlan workflow)
- **Get_approval** - Checks if repair requires approval and retrieves decision (calls GetApproval workflow)
- **Resubmit_workorder** - Resubmits corrected work order to processing queue (calls ResubmitWorkOrder workflow)
- **Log_to_itsm** - Generates ITSM incident for audit trail (calls LogToITSM workflow)

**Process Flow:**

**Mock Data:** 3 work orders (WO-12345, WO-67890, WO-11111) with different failure types

### GetFixPlan

Analyzes failure type and returns repair steps from catalog. Looks up fix plan based on failure reason.

**Mock Data:** Repair catalog with 3 failure types (schema_validation_error, timeout_config, missing_required_field)

### GetApproval

Checks approval status for repair request. Returns approval decision based on tracking ID.

**Mock Data:** 3 approval responses (WO-12345: APPROVED, WO-67890: DENIED, WO-11111: APPROVED)

### ResubmitWorkOrder

Resubmits corrected work order to processing queue. Returns confirmation with tracking ID and timestamp.

**Mock Data:** Simulated resubmission (returns status "resubmitted")

### LogToITSM

Generates ITSM incident record for audit trail. Returns incident ID with tracking information.

**Mock Data:** Generates random incident IDs (INC######)
